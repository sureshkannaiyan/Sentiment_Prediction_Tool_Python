Battery is the only thing im worried about.

Why do you want to change? Nothing wrong with s6.']

One of my Samsung phone while within warranty they replace the screen foc (free).']
i bought Samsung galaxy s6 lollipop v5..2 last June month till now mobile is more u'There is nothing wrong after update to v6.. '
After the update complete then it will optimize all the apps.'
Update is never perfect as it some apps may not able to run smoothly.'
There may have the possibility that it may not run properly partly due to the app's creator.
As for commonly used apps it should not be the problem.'
At worst case scenario the update file is corrupted in which the battery should be >5% or put on to charge by using the charger while updating.
There is nothing wrong after update to v6.. '
I have samsung galaxy 6 for less than 9 days and yesterday I noticed that is getting warm wh more u'does your mobiles battery drain as well '

My S6 is pain in arse not only the screen is many times black but the phone even switching it self off even with % battery
When sometimes someone call me the phone dies itself and then when switching it on again get the black screen causing me all the time do soft reset. 
The S6 is much better than the iPhone 6S.
S6 stops working due to lack of memory.
In my country the Galaxy S6 and the Nexus 5X are both at the same price 
I never used a Z3 but galaxy s6 is a ver nice phone and its cheaper now .
I have own the the Samsung Galaxy s6 since it came out. I love it. 
The biggest headache that now Samsung know they did not include SD slot for S6 only.'
I'm considering selling my S6 because kof absent of FM radio.]
it is highly priced and not value for money.phones with similar features are available much cheaper
In my country the Galaxy S6 and the Nexus 5X are both at the same price
The Galaxy S6 witch is more powerful
Tell me how good is the battery life time of this Samsung S6 u'Oh! It is very good  provided you do not use it all the time'
Tell me how good is the battery life time of this Samsung S6 u'owner s6 here.the battery is really not gonna hold long
Tell me how good is the battery life time of this Samsung S6 u'The battery is not good at all does really fast '
I could play the best games with high frame rate.
The battery seems to have very long life.
I was playing a lot so I can recharge it in the evening and the fast charge is ultra cool! Super fast charging is awesome and with my newly bought powerbank
The preinstalled applications are cool.
I make the best picture quality and video I have installed many applications and still the phone have a lot of space plus you get OneDrive space for 2 years plus google space and you have a lot of cloud space.
The sound is very clear during talk and loud enough so I can hear the person on loud places.'
The screen is super bright! During day even direct sunligh on my scree I can see everything super clearly! This is just awesome!'
You get a lot of camera modes from the Samsung store application for free! They are pretty cool!'
There is Ultra saving mode for the battery and believe me the phone can and will last for days maybe even a week!
The good thing is that if you don't use your phone during night the % of the battery do not drop.
You can dual screen and I found it pretty useful to check instagram and facebook at the same time or watch a video on youtube and browse the internet at the same time.'
It is elegant and with light weight.
I have installed many applications and still the phone have a lot of space plus you get OneDrive space for 2 years plus google space and you 
samsung s6 awesome phone!!!'
After updates into marshmallow there is 3G only option is missing network mode.
The battery life on this phone is horrible. Has a very very weak screen
But my biggest problem is signal has automatically Switched between 2G 3G and 4G during access the internet.
while watching videos on YouTube it's automatically switched into 2G in sometimes at the time I couldn't watch that video fully
'Samsung galaxy s6 is the best phone'

Then no need to go to Samsung.'
Tis is the worst product I have acquired in years.
Worked fine for a few days till the finger more u'You are just unlucky on having this problematic phone.'

Having 2 S5 (6GB 32GB) the 6GB became problematic and after reset it is fine.
The reboot fails 
Also I noticed that there is a blue or purple spot on pictures taken with the selfie camera is this normal? Because I find it annoying '
This has got to be the worst Samsung phone I've ever had. No removable sd card was a horrible Idea and 
i am very satisfied with its performance but rom today morning i am unable to fast charge the device do any one faced the same problem and is there any solution for this.
The overall performance is quite satisfactory but the major problem is with Battary Back up'
At least if the battaery is 3 mAH then the combination will be great.
The overall performance is quite satisfactory but the major problem is with Battary Back up'
The battery is disappointing. I need to charge it 3 times a day and all I do is check social media for  minutes different times throughout the day.
But beware battery is awful with the S6.
I have my galaxy s6  since it was realeased and it works perfectly.
My phone keeps hanging not once not twice a day but at least 5 times sometimes only  time but once it hangs it take at least a few hours like come on
It says it has changed my phone's software two times but the phone still hangs 
I can't even get the earphones into my ear it seems that I had gotten the 'unlucky' phone
Samsung s6 Edge kind of attracted me so yeah here now Im using the brand new Samsung s6 edge+
I have been using it for 3 months and I feel that.. this phone is really terrible.
On the contrary my mother's S4 works perfectly well I have no idea why does a S4 works better then a S6 speaking about S6 it's earphones sucks
I can't even get the earphones into my ear it seems that I had gotten the 'unlucky' phone
'Will S6 hang after a few months of usage?'
you just can't say that any Sony is better than Samsung
Samsung is the king in the world of phones.
The Best Smartphone 25 Now android 6. my samsung galaxy s6..so awesome??'
And another intersting thing multitasking on s6 5... Softwaresame amount of ram like z3 or z5 and multitaskig is  time betterit work better then note 5 with 4 gb 
Galaxy S6 is simply the best Very fast
Small battery but very fast charging.
i went from laggy samsung to fluid sony too;sony is faster and so much fluid than samsung more u'but i wonder how usa didnt approach sony in the market ?
which is better samsung galaxy s6 or iphone se u'IPhone 5se is more powerful then the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge.
Galaxy S6 is simply the best Very fast. Small battery but very fast charging. Amazing definition. Nice photos and videos. I bought one last friday and I\xb4m in heaven with it.
So overall I would say the S6 is better but it really comes down to your personal preference.'
If you are a part of the Apple ecosystem  then the iPhone might be your best bet.'
S6 no memory card slot '
I went from sony to galaxy and it feels like i downgraded my phone exept camera departament'
Galaxy S6 much batter then iphone 6.
s6 has batter camera batter display batter battery life with fast charging batter sound quality batter look. You should buy Galaxy S6.'
It's a great phone.
My S6 has heating problem even though is just normal usage 
I am facing a big problem with s6 after the marchemelo software update as battery consumption
The S6 is a super Korea phone it is not a cheap China phone.
When it comes to storage the galaxy s6 has a fair amount starting at 32gb
The galaxy S6 has awesome hardware so its not all bad but in practicality do you need 3gb of ram and a top end chip or something that can run all your general everyday needs.'
Over all the Galaxy S6 is a stunning phone to look at but there are other smartphones at half the price that will do you more for your buck.
Stylish!but the design brings compromise the one thing that lets this phone down is the glass finish although it looks good it attracts fingerprints more then the fingerprint scanner and thats built in with purpose. '
The battery life is apalling in simple words if you use this phone all day youll need to charge it at least twice which does not take long but it is still longer then swapping out a battery..'

Am facing Wifi issue while downloading data's with my latest updated marshmallow os.
I don't want a phone that the battery isn't going to last all day.
I do outdoor work don't want a phone that's going to die all the time.
What's up with this phone? I get the camera OK very good and the pixels yep it's nice to look at when your looks at pictured or videos.. very nice but really that's all it has going for it.
So with all this said I want a galaxy phone that doesn't over heat that the battery will last more the 8 hours.
The key is very sensitive to touch so be careful how you hold the phone in your hand.
The mobile is fast never lags camera is greatSound is good just the battery is not so great.
I have the Samsung galaxy s6 no heating problem it's a great phone for the price I will stick to this for a long time 
planning to buy Galaxy S6 but does it have heating issues as well
I had Galaxy S5 whi more I have the Samsung galaxy s6 no heating problem it's a great phone 
It is a great phone very powerful and quick with first class camera.
It's super stable and so so silky smooth! Finding myself using 
Can I buy S6 or should i wait for one plus three?'][P 9 Mar 26 If you really want to improve on battery switch off all unnecessary features in the settings. 
I had Galaxy S5 which I sold within 6 months cuz it had lotta heating issues.'
This was the biggest disappointment I ever got from Samsung and it will be my last Samsung'
now the S6 by far the worst one 
the features that made me buy the 
Samsung India just fool their customers by giving old 6. marshmallow 
Hope it will boost battery 
Based on my experience s6 is better than s6 edge because s6 didn't cut any calls. but s6 edge did many times.
Galaxy smartphone can look up to'
It does a rather good job at copying much of Samsung\xc2\x92s'
The finger print unlock is much faster too now
Also it seems like battery life has improved a bit. 
I love this phone even more. Thanks Samsung
So never buy samsung fone
Go for iphone for better service'S6 is my last fone from samsung'][u'3rd class service for updates'
'The only thing that stop me from buy this phone is the non removeble battery 
The S6 has more functionality to its camera and has a fast way to snap a photo and/or opening the app.
I have had to return my S6 twice both times it was returned under warranty and both times they had to replace the LCD
I purchased the phone in June of 25 it's now March of 26 and its been in for repair twice.
I hope these are isolated examples but I think Samsung just simply missed the mark with the S6
The only down side would have been the price difference but considering the fact that it's almost the same for you definitely go for the S6.
I thought to buy Samsung Galaxy S5 but my friend recommended me to buy Sony Xperia Z2
I'm extremely satisfied, Battery life is amazing camera is natural everything is awesome.
S6 is for regular use if you do not need anymore features although it has a lot of those already and it is cheaper than S6 Edge.
I bought this phone a  months ago and it was working well.camera is fantastic but camera drains very fast.
while im typing on the keyboard it went black! completely black and I tried number of steps on how to restart and reboot it but no luck
Some off the fetures which are on the marshmellow update for s7 are not available on the S6.
